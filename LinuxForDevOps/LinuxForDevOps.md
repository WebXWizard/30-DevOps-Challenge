# DAY-20 | Linux for DevOps Engineers

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various Linux-based operating systems (distributions). Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It is based on the Unix operating system and follows the Unix philosophy of small, modular, and reusable components. Linux is highly customizable and can be tailored to suit various needs, ranging from desktop computers and servers to embedded systems and supercomputers.

## Linux Folder Structure

The folder structure in Ubuntu Linux follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which is a standard for organizing the files and directories on a Unix-like operating system.

### Main Directories:

- `/bin`: Contains essential command-line executable files (binaries) that are available to all users.  
- `/boot`: Contains files related to the boot process, including the Linux kernel and bootloader configuration.  
- `/dev`: Contains device files that represent and allow access to hardware devices.  
- `/etc`: Contains system-wide configuration files.  
- `/home`: Home directories for individual users.  
- `/lib` and `/lib64`: Contain shared libraries needed by the system and applications.  
- `/media`: Mount point for removable media devices.  
- `/mnt`: General-purpose mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems.  
- `/opt`: Contains optional software packages.  
- `/proc`: Virtual filesystem providing information about processes and system status.  
- `/root`: Home directory for the root user.  
- `/run`: Temporary filesystem with runtime data.  
- `/sbin`: Contains system binaries for administration tasks.  
- `/srv`: Contains data for system services.  
- `/sys`: Virtual filesystem exposing kernel-related info.  
- `/tmp`: Temporary files directory.  
- `/usr`: Contains user-related programs, libraries, documentation, and shared resources.  
- `/var`: Contains variable data such as logs, databases, and spool files.
